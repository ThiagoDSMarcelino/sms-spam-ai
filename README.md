# SMS Email AI


## Overview
This project focuses on the development of an SMS and email classification system using machine learning. The aim is to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. The model has been trained using a dataset available on Kaggle, specifically the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

## Dataset
To replicate and understand the results, you can access the dataset used for training by following this link: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).

## Stop Words
The stop words utilized in this project were obtained from [this repository](https://github.com/Alir3z4/stop-words). Stop words play a crucial role in natural language processing tasks by filtering out commonly used words that do not contribute significantly to the overall meaning of a text.

## Usage
To use the SMS Email AI model, follow these steps:

1. Download the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from the provided link.
2. Install the necessary dependencies listed in the project.
3. Implement the model using the provided code.
4. Customize the model as needed for your specific use case.
